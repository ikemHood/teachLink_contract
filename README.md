🔹 PHASE 2: Advanced Features & Web3 Integration
🎯 Goal: Add interaction, monetization, and decentralized logic.

Contracts

Signature-based verification for purchases

Earnings tracking and withdrawal logic

IPFS support for metadata (optional)

🔹 PHASE 3: Launch, Scaling & Optimization
🎯 Goal: Polish UX, secure platform, and deploy to production.

CI/CD pipelines for all apps
